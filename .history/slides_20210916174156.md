author: Tomas Bulva

# Assumptions

 - you know your way around POSIX command line
 - you don't know anything about Kubernetes
 - you have some experience with docker containers
 - you have some experience with YAML (indentation)
 - you have a google account (gmail)

---

# What we are doing

 - intro
 - setup kubernetes tools on your local machine
 - login into cloud with the tools (kubectl and docker)
   - we will be deploying it on google cloud which allows K8s for free
 - explain how to declare deployment in yaml
 - we will deploy custom multi container application to the cloud
 - how to debug deployments
 - this app will be exposed to the public internet

  ## Advanced

 - you can point a domain to it and run with it

# What is Kubernetes

the name Kubernetes originates from Greek, meaning helmsman or pilot
k8s abriviation = 8 letters between k and s

- kubernetes is a container orchestration tool
- created for
  - Automation
  - Declarative configuration
  - HW abstraction
  - cloud independent/infra independent
  - deployment resiliance
  - scalability

---

# Kubernetes Anathomy

  - K8s Cluster
    - Master node
    - Kube node (kubelets)
      - pods
        - containers

---

# Basic Website Needs

  All stuff I will be deploying is JS based
  - basic backend
  - basic frontend
  - reverse proxy
  - ssl  (only if I can get freedomain)

---

# Jargon

  - Kubectl - CLI
  - Ingress is k8s term for a public facing proxy (enginx, ha proxy, apache, etc.)
  - HELM is a package manager for k8s

# setup - step 1

install gcould
  `tar -xf ./tools/google-cloud-sdk-357.0.0-darwin-x86_64.tar.gz -C ~/`
  `./google-cloud-sdk/install.sh`
install kubectl
  `gcloud components install kubectl`
install docker
  `brew install docker --cask` or [download](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/mac/install/)

# setup - step 2

- [open google cloud console](https://console.cloud.google.com/)
- create a google cloud project -> click the button or search for `create new project`
- create a service account
- create a new service account key 
  - > actions [...] 
  - > manage keys 
  - > add key 
  - > create new key
  - > download json key

# setup - step 3

- Authentificate with google cloud
  - `gcloud init`
  - `gcloud auth login`
  
- login with authentificaion helper
  - `gcloud auth activate-service-account ACCOUNT_NAME@PROJECT_NAME.iam.gserviceaccount.com --key-file=.keys/PROJECT_NAME-RANDOM_ID.json`
- configure docker to use gcloud authentification for gcloud repositories
  - `gcloud auth configure-docker`

# setup - step 4

for the next part the billing has to be enabled
this whole flow is completely free (Google gives everyone $300 to play around)
  - search for billing in the console or follow [this link](https://console.cloud.google.com/billing/)
  - fill out your info
  - activate the free trial
  - enable [Google Container Registry](https://console.cloud.google.com/gcr)
  - enable gcr api `gcloud services enable containerregistry.googleapis.com`

# setup - step 5

build docker images
  - `cd frontend`
  - `docker build -t frontend:latest .` 

docker container gcr tag
  - pick one of the repository servers
    - **gcr.io** hosts images in data centers in the United States, but the location may change in the future
    - **us.gcr.io** hosts images in data centers in the United States, in a separate storage bucket from images hosted by gcr.io
    - **eu.gcr.io** hosts the images in the European Union
    - **asia.gcr.io** hosts images in data centers in Asia
  
  - `docker tag frontend:latest HOSTNAME/PROJECT-ID/IMAGE:TAG`
  
  - push to the gcloud repository: `docker push HOSTNAME/PROJECT-ID/IMAGE`

  ...repeat for all parts frontend, restServer, socketServer

# setup - step 5
